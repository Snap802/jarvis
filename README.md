# jarvis
My tries to imitate Jarvis well


# First commit:

My first commit had me add my first attempts, which worked (unsatisfactorily), and infuriated me. They consisted of the files mictest.py and jarvis.py.

************************

Mictest was used to confirm my mic settings, after i couldnt get it to work properly.

************************
Jarvis.py was the first real effort, which was bad (I mean what do you expect!)

# Second Commit:

My second commit included:

jarvis_opt.py, which was me trying to optimize jarvis because it was very laggy, and because i used the larger vosk model, which lagged SUPREMELY hard on my potato.

jarvisx2.py, in which i attempted to fundamentally rework things. It worked for a day, and the next day it didn't. Anyway, I decided that I needed a concrete solution to make this damn thing work, which is what I did over the course of the next week, and culminated in a lot of tears, which were ulitmately rewarded with renewed efforts to BATTLE IT DOWN.

# Third Commit:

The third commit included:

main.py, which I used to rework everything, and finally had a working Jarvis, which could actually interact. I would highly recommend doing all this in a venv, because for potatos like mine, I found disk management difficult.

v3.py, which was a naive attempt at trying to design a functioning GUI and a CLI. it has several problems, which I will not delve into, because it hurts both my RAM and my eyes at this present moment. Do not try to switch to GUI only mode, it will lock you there, and I can guarantee that even hell is kinder than the task manager, when I tried to euthanize python. Also, do not try speaking, you will not be able to speak again. Having failed spectacularly, I decided to abandon this idea, and revert back to my old design, and embellish on that further.
